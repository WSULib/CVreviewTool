CVreviewTool
============

A tool designed to help librarians research self-archiving policies around faculty publications, and aggregate those results in a tidy, edit-able PDF or HTML report that can be sent directly to faculty.  For institutions conducting "CV reviews", this workflow likely sounds familiar.   The tool is web-based, with a MySQL backend, and pulling in publisher policies via the SHERPA/RoMEO freely available API.
